## Communication

Skyeye Cloud is an intelligent manufacturing project that has been maintained for 6 years. During this period, many code reconstructions have been made. Previously, it was only a commercial version. Now it is all "open source" to facilitate everyone's learning and use. However, the author also needs to survive, so all the source code and documents are placed on the knowledge planet, and you can get all the source code when you enter the planet. Welcome everyone to join ~ ~ ~
