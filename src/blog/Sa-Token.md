Think about the commemorative article that reached the summit in pig three years ago.[《合影 || 1314天，PIG 登顶码](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MzEwODY4Mw==&mid=2257486353&idx=1&sn=00202c367074415335dc6e59a537b672&scene=21#wechat_redirect)[云](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MzEwODY4Mw==&mid=2257486353&idx=1&sn=00202c367074415335dc6e59a537b672&scene=21#wechat_redirect)》Next, I got a cold general reply：

I still remember at that time: I was sitting in a snack bar in Shaxian County, eating a 1 plate of fried rice noodles, and when I turned on my cell phone, I received a cold reply.

At that time, my idea was: just me? How is it possible to have a chicken with a small dish.

But my heart is unwilling: yes, it is me, why not? What if.

This sentence gave me great motivation and kept me going until today.

Three years ago, Leng Zong's unintentional 1 reply indirectly predicted today's Sa-Token summit.

When I pressed f5 to refresh the webpage, Sa-Token replaced pig and rose to No. 1 on the list.

At this moment, I actually have mixed feelings inside.

Please allow me to be melodramatic.

I think of the well-known frameworks/open source projects I used and learned about when I first started working: Hutool, MyBatis-Plus, RuoYi, Layui, OneBlog, JFinal, FastJson, Dubbo......

At that time, I studied hard to use them and read their source code.

I remembered my teacher once told me: "Don't delete your small encapsulated framework, it will be useful to find a job in the future."

I think of one of my bosses, who sat next to me when I was working overtime until 12 o'clock in the evening and pointed to Sa-Token official website and said, "believe it or not, you will definitely rely on this for dinner in the future."

I think of some negative voices Sa-Token received along the way, some are criticism, some are suggestions, some are satirical, and some are verbal abuse, including attacks on myself and my family.

I remembered that night, my friend and I were walking in the street. Suddenly I couldn't hear what he was saying. My tears couldn't stop falling. My mind was full of that comment, that comment that made me break the defense.

I think of when I was at school, I was thrown the test paper on the ground in public, called my father's name frivolously, and called all kinds of interesting nicknames they thought they were. I was robbed of the tap just because I refuted the 1 sentence and threatened to hit me. He was called a "silly dog". The data cable that was bought for 5 yuan was cut off. I was surrounded by 1 group of people in bed at night, teaching me to say something wrong in qq group, let me apologize.

That night, the 1 group of people, a face, I can see, can't see, are disgusting.  

I remember how embarrassed I was at the time.

I remembered that after everyone went to sleep, I used to walk alone on the playground, biting my teeth and keeping tears. Not crying was the last stubbornness I could do at that time.

These things are insignificant and not worth mentioning compared to those who have truly experienced 'campus violence'. But these things have caused me great psychological trauma for a long time.  

I used to think of many ways to get back at them. I also had childish fantasies that I would one day become Superman and have superpowers to torture them.

But after today, I don't want to do this anymore. I didn't forgive them. I just want to forget them.

Because I really want to understand what I want in this life, what kind of person I want to be, what kind of things I should do.

I 've spent a lot of time thinking about what open source means:

The significance of open source lies in the openness of the means of production, so that those at the top of the world cannot easily monopolize all means of production.

In this world, some people can earn a lot of money as long as they lie in bed and sleep every day.

Others need to work hard in a small house day after day to earn a little money.

Some people's descendants can drive luxury cars every day and travel around the world for fun.

The descendants of some people can only stay in a small county for a lifetime, or even can't get out of their own town for decades.

We stay in the same blue sky, breathing the same air, looking at the same stars.

But some people, born is the protagonist, some people, born is cattle and horses.

I don't know if this plot is reasonable. Who is the director behind the scenes, I don't want to delve.

I just want to contribute my 1 strength, disclose more means of production, so that more proletarians have the strength and opportunity to try more possibilities, and have more time to truly enjoy the world.

I want everyone to be the protagonist of this world.

(Is the pattern a bit too big, then smaller)

I 've spent a lot of time thinking about why I'm involved in open source:

Throw away the superficial ones: bringing better job opportunities, meeting more bosses, or occasionally some reward income.

I think the bottom is: creation.

Writing code is a creative process, especially the open source framework. Every line of code needs to be carefully polished, just like creating 1 perfect artwork, drawing, composing and writing novels.

Constantly upgrade and iterate on the 1 thing to make it perfect. This is the 1 state of flow, 1 a sense of creative satisfaction, just like Hemingway made "The Old Man and the Sea", Nolan made "Interstellar".

When the 1 piece of exquisite art is born, as the author, there will be a kind of proud psychology.

I will continue because:

I am a-a writer.

At this moment, my computer is playing the 1 lyrics:

The heart of the free world,

So clear and lofty.

Blooming and never dying--

Blue Lotus--
